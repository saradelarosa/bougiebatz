      Because we are using a non-relational database (MongoDB), some crafty matching is being done in order to set the states
      of whether a user has liked and/or saved a particular article (or not) and how many likes an article has from different
      users of the site. There is a lot of looping and matching done here on in the controller logic. The endpoints at the backend
      could be written to loop through the data stored in the database to find if a particular article is stored there or not, but 
      in this way it can be guaranteed that the loooping through all the data only happens a finite number of times instead of
      obfuscating the looping by using mongoose methods to find whether or not a particular article is in trending or a user's
      saved/liked list.

      Of course, using a relational database would be better, especially as the user base grows. But given the time constraints of 
      this project and the relatively small user base, doing some looping here to perform some matching is okay for now.
