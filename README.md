What's in this repo?

* Client: 
  - frontend based on Angular framework
      - App sub-folders
          - auth: login, registration page
          - comment: side-window that pops up when comment button is clicked
          - factory_function: houses main factories for frontend logic
          - latest: main page with all new articles loaded. main landing page after 
            auth is complete
          - modal: popup triggered by a button that displays more information about the clicked article
          - savedStory: page rendered that downloads a user's saved articles from the database
          - trending: page rendered that downloads all "liked" articles for all users
  - SASS directory that controls styling. CSS directory is automatically compiled
    after GULP is run, i.e. not touched manually! We have ignored it because it rebuilds automatically,
    but delete as needed and it will recompile.
  - Assets - we saved and hard coded some of the angular files within the JS folder in assets because Katie
    had some issues with Bower and using chocolatey on her windows computer

* Client_old:
  - Client files written by the original team, written in React
  - Webpack is commented out here, but will be used to run this project if you want react and webpack
  - Run npm start in one tab and webpack -w in another
  - Kept intact within the project repository in case there is desire to switch back to React

* Server:
  - models: 
      - articleModel.js is the schema sketched to design articles that are saved to the "liked" or "
        "comment" database
      - userModel.js is schema sketched for users. note the empty array for savedStories. when a user
        saves a story, an article is pushed to this array
  - routes:
      - articleRoutes: endpoints for GET and POST requests to "like" and "comment on" articles
      - auth: routing logic for authorization
      - newsRoutes: GET request for external NYT API
  - db.js: connects to Mongo database on mLabs (through heroku addons)
  - server.js: 
      - includes required backend node modules, necessary middleware, and endpoints to connect to 
        connect to the database

* Testing:
        - Utilized a Karma config file using mocha, sinon and chai to create tests with the Gulpfile
        - All tests are written in testmodule.js in the test folder
        - To run the tests, run 'gulp karma' in your terminal
